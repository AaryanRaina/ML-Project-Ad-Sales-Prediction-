# Project Name : Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Objectives:
For this project, I developed and assessed several linear regression models utilizing Python. I employed scikit-learn to compute the regressions, managed the data with pandas, and visualized it using seaborn. The dataset utilized in this project is the well-known Advertising dataset, aiming to forecast sales revenue by analyzing advertising expenditures across various media channels like TV, radio, and newspapers.

## Overview :
             * Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn
             
             * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn
             
             * Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as MAE, MSE, RÂ² and RMSE
             
             * Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
